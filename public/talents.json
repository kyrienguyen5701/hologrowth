However, she soon stumbled unknowingly upon the Forbidden Truth, and was turned into an apostle for the Ancient Ones.\n \"Space\" refers not only to this universe we live in, but all dimensions and matter to exist. It is a concept unbridled by definition, and one that continues to grow in scope limitlessly. As it is yet to be fully explored by man, her seemingly strange behavior and speech can be explained away with a simple, \"Humanity simply isn't yet ready to understand.\"\n As a side note, despite how she may look, she is quite chi... young.\n "

Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.\n She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.\n For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels. That is what gave her the idea of making her own friend out of a material that was indispensable to the development of human civilization: paper.\n \"It may fade and rip, but once a friend, forever a friend.\"\n "
